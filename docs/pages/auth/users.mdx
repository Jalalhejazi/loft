import CreateUserFragment from '../fragments/auth/create-user.mdx'

loft provides to different authentication mechanisms:
- [Authentication using username and password](#username--password-auth)
- [Authentication using a third-party provider via OpenID Connect](#openid-connect-auth)

## Username + Password Auth
By default, username and password based authentication is enabled. Admins can [add users](#add-users) and send them invite links to sign up. Additionally, admins can [reset user passwords](#reset-passwords). Users can also change their credentials in the [profile view of the UI](../profile/basics.mdx) after signing in.

Authentication using username and password [can also be disabled](./oidc.mdx#disable-password-auth) which is particularly useful for organizations that want to enforce security standards such as two factor authentication (2FA) using a third-party provider.


## OpenID Connect Auth
[OpenID Connect](./oidc.mdx) allows users to authenticate using a third-party provider. Notable providers include:
- GitHub / GitHub Enterprise
- GitLab
- Google
- Microsoft
- and many others

Learn more about how to configure [OpenID Connect Authentication](./oidc.mdx).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubectl">

Delete a user using `kubectl`:
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Make sure to switch to the context of the loft management cluster!
kubectl delete user [USER_NAME]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning Data Loss
Deleting a user will also delete all cluster accounts that are owned solely by this user. [Deleting these accounts in turn will also delete other related objects](../clusters/accounts.mdx#delete-accounts) such as account quotas and spaces.

## Cluster Roles
loft provides an ClusterRole named `loft-management-admin` that can be assigned to users. This role will allow users to manage all loft-related ressources within the loft cluster, i.e. user, cluster, team etc.

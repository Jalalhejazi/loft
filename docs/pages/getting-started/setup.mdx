<TabItem value="on-premise">

:::note Why On-Premise?
The on-premise edition of loft is a good choice for:
- larger companies with many users and different teams
- teams that run Kubernetes within a (virtual) private cloud (without public IP)
- teams that work behind a corporate firewall
:::

-->

## Requirements  
To install the on-premise edition of loft, you need:
- kubectl
- helm v3 (check with `helm version`)
- a kube-context with admin access to a Kubernetes cluster

<TabItem value="saas">

:::note Why SaaS?
The Hybrid SaaS Edition of loft is a good choice for:
- teams that run Kubernetes clusters within a public cloud
- teams that want to save the admin cost for maintaining and upgrading loft
- teams with less experience regarding Kubernetes administration
:::

:::caution No Kubernetes Hosting
loft does <u>**not**</u> offer Kubernetes hosting. Even with the SaaS edition, you need to connect your own clusters. See the table above for details between the Hybrid SaaS Edition and On-Premise Edition.

## Install loft CLI
Installing the loft CLI lets you create spaces and retrieve kube-contexts for your spaces right from the terminal of your IDE, which is often much faster than using the UI.
